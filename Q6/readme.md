The task was to reproduce a dashing action with shader with a red outline and a shadow trail following the player.

I was able to implement the dash, however due to time constraints I was unable to implement the shaders. The dash functions by checking a set number of tiles ahead of the player, then movin the player tile-by-tile until the player has completed the dash
or the player can not move into the next tile.
